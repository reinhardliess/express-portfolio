# JavaScript Techdegree Project #6: Static Node.js and Express Site

A live version of this project can be found [here]().

The goal of this project was to create a portfolio site to showcase the projects I've built.
The site contains a modern landing page, an about page with contact info, info about myself, and a series of project pages to show off and detail the first five projects from the Techdegree.
